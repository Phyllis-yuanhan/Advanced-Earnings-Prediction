 Advanced Earnings Prediction: Enhanced Models and Accuracy Assessment

Note: All datasets are accessed via the WRDS platform, with queries executed using the 'raw_sql' function and SQL statements.

There are five parts to this group project:

1. Use the earnings data from 2010-2019 and forecast earnings by using the three models we have learned (HVZ, earnings persistence, residual income) and assess which model generates the most precise forecasts (relative to actual earnings reported). Use the data from Compustat from 2010 to 2022 for this step. Using the data from 2010 to 2019, train the three earnings prediction models discussed in class, and compare the accuracy of these models in out-of-sample period forecasts (for years 2020, 2021, and 2022).

2. Based on the best model from 1), further improve the model by considering additional factors. Additional factors include anything we believe may help, including the most recent analyst forecast (released prior to earnings) or textual analysis of management/other disclosures. Note that an excellent analysis of this part may use textual analysis (not included in this version of codes).

3. Based on the coefficients we estimate above, forecast 2020 annual earnings per share (EPS) for 10 stocks we pick. Discuss the 10 firms we picked: business, industry, and information environment, and the model performance, comparing forecasted earnings to the analystsâ€™ forecast for the period

4. Apply coefficients estimated in part 2 above to 2022 data to predict the top 10 firms that are most likely to exhibit the largest earnings growth in 2023.

5. Narrow the top 10 firms to the top 3 using qualitative factors and prepare a 5-minute pitch for the 3 stocks we recommend!
